Final project of Embedded Systems Laboratory (7th semester).

Implementation of a Morse Code receiver and transmitter (decoder and encoder) using Altera DE10 Nano board. 

This project combines the FPGA fabric and the ARM processor inside the development board to create an embedded system. 

We used the Golden Hardware Reference Design included in the board's examples as a starting point for the setup in Quartus software.
